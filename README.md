# CreditRisk

To solve this task I used some data preprocesing and feature engineering tehniques. Also I defined base model, you can find this part in [preprocesing_and_final_model](https://github.com/koren-v/CreditRisk/blob/master/preprocesing_and_final_model.ipynb) notebook.

Also I used Neural Net and LGBM, that showed better performance, so I decided to use one of ensemble methods - Blending.
This models you can find in following notebooks:
* [Neural Net](https://github.com/koren-v/CreditRisk/blob/master/nn_with_fastai.ipynb)
* [Light GBM](https://github.com/koren-v/CreditRisk/blob/master/lgbm.ipynb)
